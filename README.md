This exercise will focus on refactoring existing code to improve accesibility.
We were given starter html code and a css style sheet and were asked to improve both documents.
The Html code was improved by replacing DIV tags with more precise and descriptive tags such as body, main, section.
The CSS sheet was simplified mainly by combining styling for elements with the same properties.
This repository will display the changes made which were aimed at simplifying the code.
The modified files can be found under the develop--index.html and develop--assets--css--style.css
The html link for the finished site is [http://127.0.0.1:5500/FSF-PT-EAST-APRIL-040824-main/FSF-PT-EAST-APRIL-040824-1/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Develop/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Develop/index.html)
